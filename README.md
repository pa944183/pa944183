## For this assignment, I chose to first use the Beautiful Soup web scraping tool. The main reason I chose this was because I had slight previous experience working with it, but also because I felt it fit the dataset better. Because it was a relatively small script to scrape in and not large amounts of data I felt that Beautiful Soup would be easier to implement into a python script for this project. The steps to execute this were relatively simple. First, I had to define the URL and scraper style, while also using a parser to identify the needed information. I then created functions to convert dates to datetime and decipher between the flight type as well as engine status. Finally I created a function to extract and store the necessary data from the table. Overall this did not take too long to run, especially after the first time, the data seemed to be read in pretty quickly. 



## In building this project I used Jupyter Notebook as well as VScode to write my program. While my final code was done in Jupyter I also employed VScode to test certain techniques/libraries. Over the course of the development of this work, I faced a couple issues that I had to research/experiment with to find solutions. My first issue I came across was in converting the dates. At first I did not realize that the dates were in the wrong format and thus was getting invalid outputs and errors that I then had to correct. I also faced issues with getting my ScrapeGraphAI to work as I had never used the tool before and it had a bit of a learning curve in setting up.
